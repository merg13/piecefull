Core requirements for the puzzle feature
Puzzle board management
Initialization: The system shall create and display a puzzle board of a configurable size (e.g., a grid of 4x4, 8x8, etc.) within a client-side component.
State representation: The system shall maintain the state of all puzzle pieces, including their current position, correct position, orientation, and a flag indicating whether they are part of a larger, connected group.
User interaction: The system shall be capable of receiving and processing user inputs such as drag-and-drop actions on individual or grouped pieces.
Winning condition: The system shall be able to detect when all pieces have been correctly snapped into their final positions and declare the game as complete.
Realistic puzzle piece generation
Dynamic generation: The system shall generate a set of unique, interlocking puzzle piece shapes based on the specified board dimensions.
Image slicing: The system shall slice a source image into the corresponding number of pieces, masking each image slice with its unique puzzle piece shape.
Interlocking geometry: Each piece's geometry shall be defined by a series of Bezier curves that create tabs and slots, where an adjacent piece's edge geometry is a mirrored inverse of its neighbor's.
Data representation: The generated piece data shall be serialized into a format that includes image data (e.g., data URL or SVG), shape path information, and dimensional metadata.
Efficient rendering: The system shall be able to render a large number of puzzle pieces efficiently without significant performance degradation.
Collision detection
Boundary detection: The system shall perform broad-phase collision detection using the bounding boxes of moving pieces to efficiently identify potential collisions.
Proximity checking: For pieces within close proximity, the system shall conduct a more precise, narrow-phase check to determine if the edges are aligned for a snap action.
Group collision: The system shall handle collisions involving a group of already connected pieces as a single unit.
Snapping pieces into place
Correct proximity: A piece shall be eligible to snap into place with a neighbor if it is within a defined distance tolerance of the neighbor's correct alignment point.
Correct orientation: The piece must also be in the correct rotational orientation to successfully snap into place.
Visual feedback: The system shall provide a clear visual indicator (e.g., an animation, a sound effect) when pieces successfully snap together.
Group merging: When two individual pieces or two connected groups snap together, the system shall merge them into a single, cohesive, draggable unit.
Piece finalization: Once a piece or a group is correctly aligned with all its neighbors, it shall be marked as "finalized" and become un-draggable.
Non-functional requirements
Performance: The puzzle board and pieces shall respond to user interactions with minimal latency and maintain a smooth frame rate, even with a high number of pieces.
Scalability: The system shall handle a wide range of puzzle complexities, from a small number of large pieces to a large number of small pieces, without degrading performance.
Reliability: The state of the puzzle shall be robust to rapid user actions, preventing pieces from becoming disconnected or improperly aligned.
Traceability: Every puzzle piece shall have a unique identifier that can be used to track its position and state throughout the game.
